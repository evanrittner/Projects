The results of this project are not really meant to be useful in a practical sense, for the sole reason that determining
the standard deviation of one's throw is not very easy. That being said, here's possibly the most reasonable method for
doing that.

You will need to throw a large number of darts. Aim at the bullseye, and keep track of:

* what percentage hit the board at all (Percentage #1),
* what percentage hit within the triple ring (excluding the triple ring itself) (Percentage #2),
* what percentage hit either the inner or outer bullseye (Percentage #3), and
* what percentage hit the inner bullseye (Percentage #4).

You might want to count the first dozen or so throws as practice, and exclude them from the data.

Using the table below, find what
standard deviation value gives the most similar percentages to what you threw.
