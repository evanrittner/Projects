# Riddlers

The news website [fivethirtyeight.com](https://fivethirtyeight.com/) publishes two weekly puzzles, called the Riddler Express and Riddler Classic. This part of the repository holds my solutions to some of the puzzles. Many have a programming element, but not all do. Some of the more recent ones also have a report summarizing my work.

Each Riddler below has a short description, along with the link to the problem online. I'd recommend following that link to get an understanding of the problem.

If you are just browsing, some favorites of mine I want to highlight are [Reset Die](Reset%20Die/), [Veinte](Veinte/), and [Jenga](Jenga/).
