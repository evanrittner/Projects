# Riddlers

The news website [fivethirtyeight.com](https://fivethirtyeight.com/) publishes two weekly puzzles, called the Riddler Express and Riddler Classic. This part of the repository holds my solutions to some of the puzzles. Many have a programming element, but not all do. Some of the more recent ones also have a report summarizing my work.
