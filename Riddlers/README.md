# Riddlers

The news website [fivethirtyeight.com](https://fivethirtyeight.com/) publishes two weekly puzzles, called the Riddler Express and Riddler Classic. This part of the repository holds my solutions to some of the puzzles. Many have a programming element, but not all do. Some of the more recent ones also have a report summarizing my work.

- **[Veinte](Riddlers/Veinte/)**
  - [Riddler Classic, 5/14/21](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/are-you-smarter-than-a-fourth-grader/)

- **[Cornhole](Riddlers/Cornhole/)**
  - [Riddler Express, 4/30/21](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/can-you-systematically-solve-a-friday-crossword/)
  - Given a set of throws for a game of cornhole (i.e. aggressive, conservative, wasted), and their respective score probablility distributions, determine the ideal strategy to maximize the chance of scoring exactly three points.

- **[Jenga](Riddlers/Jenga/)**
  - [Riddler Classic, 2/19/21](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/can-you-win-riddler-jenga/)
  - Stack Jenga blocks by placing the center of each block randomly on the previous. On average, how many blocks can be placed before the tower topples?

- **[Golden Spheres](Riddlers/Golden%20Spheres/)**
  - [Riddler Classic, 6/19/20](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/can-you-flip-the-magic-coin/)
  - What is the minimum number of spheres, with diameters 1, 2, 3, ..., that can be evenly distributed, by volume, into three groups?

- **[Reset Die](Riddlers/Reset%20Die/)**
  - [Riddler Classic, 3/27/20](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/can-you-get-the-gloves-out-of-the-box/)
  - Play a game by rolling a die six times, then replacing the numbers on its faces by the results of the six rolls. How long until the faces of the die are all one number?

- **[Delirious Ducks](Riddlers/Delirious%20Ducks/)**
  - [Riddler Classic, 1/17/20](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/can-you-track-the-delirious-ducks/)
  - There are two ducks, starting on the center tile of a 3x3 grid. If each second, each moves one unit in one of the cardinal directions (staying on the grid), how long until they occupy the same tile again? (What about more ducks, a larger grid, or higher dimensions?)
