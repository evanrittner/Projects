# 2048 Game

2048 is a simple game that involves a 4x4 grid of numbers. By swiping up, down, left, or right, pairs of matching tiles can be forced to combine, creating increasing powers of two. When the board fills up entirely without a move to be made, the game is over. Below is an image of the board during the game.

For this project, I used ncurses, a library for C to control terminal output. The code is organized in a single file, and is quite well documented.
